    bio: `Cryo Design is a multidisciplinary design studio specializing in brand identity, packaging, and visual communication. We believe that great design isn't just seen—it's felt. Every mark, every color, every detail serves a purpose.

Founded on the principle that brands deserve more than templates, we craft identities from the ground up or breathe new life into existing ones. Whether you're launching something new or reimagining what exists, we're here to translate your vision into a visual language that resonates.

Our process is collaborative, iterative, and obsessively detail-oriented. We don't do cookie-cutter. We do custom. We do considered. We do Cryo.`,
    philosophy: `We approach every project as a blank canvas. No assumptions. No shortcuts. Just pure, intentional design thinking. From the first sketch to the final delivery, we obsess over the details so you don't have to.

Our work spans logos, packaging, illustration, and corporate identity—but at the core, it's all the same thing: solving problems through design.`,
